# Amicable-Numbers
To solve this problem, and to find the amicable pairs under 10000, algorithmic approach is used.
Step by step solution to solve the problem-
1. Initially, we will find the prime numbers under 10000, and eliminate that in order to reduce the complexity.
2. After that from the remaining numbers, we will the sum of divisors of the remaining numbers.
3. Then in the next step, specify the condition for the amicable pair and then find out the amicable pair of numbers.
4. After finding the amicable pairs, evaluate the sum of all.
5. Step by step solution is done along with the code snippet.
