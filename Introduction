# Amicable-Numbers
To solve this problem, and to find the amicable pairs under 10000, algorithmic approach is used.
Step by step solution to solve the problem-
1.Initially,find all the prime numbers under 10000, and eliminate them from the series in order to reduce the complexity.
2 Find the divisors of all the remaining numbers. 
3.Then, calculate the sum of divisors of all the numbers.
4.Then specify the condition for the amicable pair to find out such pairs.
5.After finding the amicable pairs, calculate thier sum.
6.Step by step solution is done along with the code snippet.
