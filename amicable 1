Amicable pairs have 2 different numbers in which sum of the proper divisors of each number is equal to the other number.
We have to find out amicable pair under 10000.
First we will eliminate all prime numbers because prime numbers have only 2 factors 1 and itself. 

C program to find all the prime numbers between 1 to 10000-
int main()
{
    int n,i,fact,j;
    printf("Enter the Number");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Prime Numbers are: \n");
    for(i=1; i<=n; i++)
    {
        fact=0;
        for(j=1; j<=n; j++)
        {
            if(i%j==0)
                fact++;
        }
        if(fact==2)
            printf("%d " ,i);
    }
