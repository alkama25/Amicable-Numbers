According to problem 1, amicable number are the numbers sum of whose divisors are equal. 
We have to find out amicable pair under 10000.
For this, initially we will eliminate prime numbers because prime numbers cannot form amicable pairs. 
So we will find all the prime numbers under 10000 and eliminate them from the list.

C program to find all the prime numbers between 1 to 10000-
int main()
{
    int n,i,fact,j;
    printf("Enter the Number");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Prime Numbers are: \n");
    for(i=1; i<=n; i++)
    {
        fact=0;
        for(j=1; j<=n; j++)
        {
            if(i%j==0)
                fact++;
        }
        if(fact==2)
            printf("%d " ,i);
    }
